# Automatic-Extraction-of-Lumped-RLC-Equivalents-in-Microstrip-Technology
This project focuses on the automatic extraction and modeling of lumped RLC equivalent circuits that approximate the behavior of passive components implemented on microstrip transmission lines. The goal is to develop a Python-based tool capable of characterizing microwave devices by controlling a VNA remotely.
